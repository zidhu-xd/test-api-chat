I already have a working React Native Android APK that looks like a normal calculator app on launch.
The app already has a secret chat feature and a working backend (use my existing backend URL exactly as it is, do NOT change backend logic or endpoints).

🔢 Calculator & Secret Access Logic

On app open, show a fully functional native calculator UI.

Default secret access code is 1234.

When the user enters 1234 and presses the equals button, this should open the hidden secret flow.

🔁 First Time Secret Access (1234 – First Use)

When 1234 is entered for the first time, show a hidden screen with two options only:

Generate Pairing Code

Enter Pairing Code

“Generate Pairing Code” should generate a unique pairing code using existing backend logic.

“Enter Pairing Code” should allow the user to input a code and pair with another device.

🔄 Factory Reset Code

If the user enters 5678 on the calculator and presses equals:

Perform a full factory reset inside the app:

Clear all chats

Unpair all devices

Reset secret state

Reset settings

Clear locally stored app data (like app storage reset)

After reset, entering 1234 again must behave like first time setup and show pairing options again.

💬 Secret Chat Screen

After successful pairing, open the secret chat screen.

Show a Chat icon UI.

On the top right of the chat screen, add a three dot (⋮) menu.

⋮ Three Dot Menu Options

When the user taps the three dot menu, show:

Clear Chat

Settings

⚙️ Settings Screen (VERY IMPORTANT)

Inside Settings, implement the following:

🔐 Security

Option to change the calculator secret passcode (default is 1234).

New passcode must be saved securely in app storage.

🔌 Pairing

Option to Unpair Device:

Disconnect from paired user

Clear chat history

Return to pairing screen on next 1234 entry

🎭 App Icon Customization

Allow the user to change the APK app icon from inside the app.

Provide multiple selectable icons (calculator, notes, system-style icons, etc).

Selected icon must:

Persist after app restart

Reflect immediately using Android dynamic icon switching

🗂 App Storage

Settings changes must persist using proper local storage (AsyncStorage / SecureStorage).

📩 Chat UI Behaviour (WhatsApp-like)

The app already has:

Blue tick when the other user sees the message

Modify behavior so that:

If multiple messages are sent, only the LAST message shows the blue tick

Add timestamp to every message.

Allow swipe left on a message to:

Show message time

Reply to that specific message (reply preview like WhatsApp)

⚠️ Rules

Do NOT remove or rewrite existing secret chat logic.

Do NOT break backend integration.

Use my existing backend URL exactly.

No placeholder logic.

No demo code.

Everything must be production-ready and error-free.

🎯 Goal

Update the existing app by adding these features cleanly, without breaking current functionality, and keeping the calculator disguise intact.
